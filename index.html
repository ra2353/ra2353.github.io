		<p>Smartphones are an essential aspect of modern life. They are instrumental tools in which we function through work, friends, and family.  Their necessity is pretty much agreed upon. However, what is often overlooked when it comes to smartphones is how the progression of 21st century can be attributed to the progression of the phones. Like all industries, the smartphones golden age of change and improvements took place a little bit after their introduction, with massive innovations in features, cameras and performance. The phones we use on a daily basis have gone through multiple iterations to get to where they are today. As a tech nerd, it is my pleasure to recount the innovations and progress of the smartphones I personally have owned over the years, and consider how it affected the industry and technology as a whole. Anyone can find reviews of these phones, but whats not often mentioned is how the phone has aged over time and the various level of impact it may have caused.
